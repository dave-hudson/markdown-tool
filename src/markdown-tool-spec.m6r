Context: Markdown lexer
    Context: Core functionality
        The tool will scan a markdown file and lexically analyze it.

    Context: Lexer
        The lexer will be implemented as a class that is passed a file.  It will expose a function, get_next_token() that
        will return the next token in the file.  When there are no more tokens it will emit a special end-of-file token.

        Context: Tokens
            The tokens emitted by the lexer should include the token type, the value of the token, the line number on
            which the token was found, and the column number at which it was found that that line.

        Context: Errors
            Carefully check that elements are well formed.  If any elements are not well formed in file being parsed
            then emit error tokens to indicate the problem.

    Context: Markdown grammar
        The EBNF grammar of the markdown is given here:

        Embed: src/markdown.ebnf

    Context: Output
        Context:
            On lexing a markdown file, emit details of the tokens that are being returned from the lexer to the console.

    Context: Tool invocation
        Context: Command line tool
            The application will be run from the command line with appropriate command line parameters.

        Context: Default parameter
            The default command line parameter is the name of the source markdown file.

    Context: Implementation and dependencies
        As an engineer working with the application, I want the application to be easy to use and understand,
        so I can maintain and enhance it over time.

        Context: Implement in Python 3
            The tool will be written in the latest version of Python 3.

        Context: No external dependencies
            Do not use any external depencies other than standard components that are distributed with the Python 3
            runtime.

        Context: Indentation of code
            Code must be indented by 4 spaces.

        Context: Use of docstrings
            Use docstrings to describe all modules, classes, and functions.

        Context: Use of comments
            Use additional comments to describe any complex logic.

        Context: PEP 8 imports
            The import list in any module should follow PEP 8 guidelines.

        Context: Avoid unnecessary elif and else statements
            Do not use elif or else statements if the preceding statement returns.
